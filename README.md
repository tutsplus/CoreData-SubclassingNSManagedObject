### Tuts+ Tutorial: Core Data from Scratch: Subclassing NSManagedObject

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

Earlier in this series, we created Done, a simple application to learn more about the NSFetchedResultsController class. In that project, we used key value coding and key value observing to create and update records. This works fine, but from the moment your project has any kind of complexity, you'll quickly run into issues. Subclassing NSManagedObject makes this much easier.
